NEWS REGARDING BYTEIO 0.01

- Added read function family: these functions have adequate prototype to
  function `getc', and work similarly. On error, they return junk and pass
  errno from fread.

  Prototype:
  <TYPE> byteio_read_<TYPE> (FILE *);

- Added write function family: these functions have adequate prototype to
  function `putc', and work similarly. On error, they return EOF and pass errno
  from fwrite.

  Prototype:
  int byteio_write_<TYPE> (FILE *, <TYPE>);

- Added readsafe function family: these functions have prototypes like write,
  but behave like read. The second parameter is a pointer, whose target is set
  to the read value. This function is faster than read.

  Prototype:
  int byteio_readsafe_<TYPE> (FILE *, <TYPE> *);
